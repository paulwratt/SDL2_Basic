# New Repo Master
There is are a couple of bugs that need fixing before anything else, but since there is no activity on the orginal repo using that repos Issues is pointless, and a forked repo does not allow Issues, it made sense to rebuild the GitHub repo from scratch. At least now (if others wish to) PR's can be accomodated.
